## Problem Statement ü§î

- How swiftly are orders delivered on average?
- Unveiling the yearly sales saga since 2012: Is there a steady ascent?
- Who are the powerhouse customers?
- Profits and losses: Product-wise revelations.
- Delving into more data-driven insights from our sales numbers.

## Data Sourcing üìä

Armed with questions, I acquired the dataset by downloading the CSV file, unleashing it into Power BI for a meticulous journey of cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

It comprises three tables:
1. **ORDERS:** 51,291 rows, 24 columns
2. **PEOPLE:** 24 rows, 2 columns
3. **RETURNS:** 1,079 rows, 3 columns

## Data Transformation/Cleaning üßπ

Utilizing the Power Query Editor in Power BI, the data underwent a transformative journey. [See screenshot for applied steps]

Key steps included:
- Setting the first row as headers in the PEOPLE and RETURNS tables.
- Analytical transformation of the 'ORDER' table:
  - Calculation of 'delivery days' using "custom columns": `delivery days = [shipped date] - [order date]`
  - Creation of a new column for the year of the order date: [Order Year]
  - Addition of a conditional column to the 'RETURNS' table to assign a numeric value to the 'Returned' response (YES: 1, NO: 0).
  - Changing datatype from 'TEXT' to 'WHOLE NUMBER'.

## Data Modeling üé®

Power BI wove connections between tables, crafting a star schema model. The 'Order' table takes center stage as the fact table, with 'Return' and 'People' tables gracefully linked via common columns: 'order ID' and Region, respectively.
